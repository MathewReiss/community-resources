This is a simple dithering library for blending colors on Pebble. This library works for both Aplite and Basalt, although for Aplite you will be limited to GColorWhite and GColorBlack as your choices. You can create different "shades" of your combined colors in increments of 10% or 25%. The library can currently draw rectangles and circles, and more shapes may be added in the future. You can choose between ordered and random dithering. There are also functions for smoothly fading between colors, using the transition timer.
